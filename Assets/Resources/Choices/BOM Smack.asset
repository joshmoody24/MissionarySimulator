  name: Smack [r.name] with the Book of Mormon
  description: Not the best way to share the gospel.
  resultText: '[s.name] considered smacking [r.name] with the Book of Mormon to get
    [r.his] attention. But [s.he] quickly realized that this was not a loving or
    effective way to share the gospel. [r.name] would likely feel hurt and defensive,
    and [s.name] could not risk damaging [r.his] relationship with [r.him]. Instead,
    [s.name] took a deep breath and calmly approached [r.name], ready to have a respectful
    conversation about the gospel.'
