  description: Time to...uh...share something?
  resultText: '[s.name] tried to stand tall and proud, ready to share [s.his] testimony
    about [topic]. But as [s.he] began to speak, [s.his] nerves got the better of
    [s.him]. [r.name] leaned in, trying to listen, but [s.name] was mumbling so quietly
    that [r.name] could barely make out a word [s.he] was saying.

    

    "I-uh-I
    guess I just, uh, really believe in this? And, um, I guess it''s just really
    important to me?" [s.name] stammered, clearly struggling to find the right words.
    [r.name] tried to look encouraging, but [s.he] couldn''t help but think that
    this was one of the weakest testimonies [r.he]''d ever heard.'
