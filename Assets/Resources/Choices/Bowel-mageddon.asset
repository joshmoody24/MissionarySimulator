  description: Uh oh...
  resultText: '[s.name] suddenly clutched [s.his] stomach, a look of alarm spreading
    across [s.his] face. [r.name] took a step back, wondering what was wrong. "What''s
    wrong, [s.name]?" [s.name] groaned, "I think I''ve got the worst case of indigestion
    ever!" [r.name] chuckled, "Well, that doesn''t sound so bad." [s.name] shook
    [s.his] head, "No, no, no, you don''t understand. This is Bowel-mageddon, the
    ultimate case of indigestion! I might never be the same again!" [r.name] couldn''t
    help but laugh at [s.name]''s silly antics, as [s.he] made a big show of pretending
    to be in utter agony. In the end, a few antacids and a good laugh were all it
    took to calm the "explosive" situation and get [s.name] back on track to sharing
    the gospel.'
