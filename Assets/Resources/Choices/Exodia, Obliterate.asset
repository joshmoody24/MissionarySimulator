  description: Summon the power of Exodia!
  resultText: '[s.name] raised [s.his] arms and called out, "Exodia, Obliterate!"
    [r.name] looked around, unsure of what was happening. Suddenly, a gust of wind
    swept through the room and [r.name] felt as though the world was being lifted
    from under [r.him]. [r.name] looked back at [s.name] with wide eyes, "What just
    happened?" [s.name] simply grinned and replied, "I summoned the power of Exodia!
    And let''s just say, [r.name], you''re about to be in for a wild ride!" [r.name]
    gulped and held on tight as [s.name] took [r.him] on a hilarious, whirlwind adventure,
    all while [s.name] remained in complete control, thanks to the power of Exodia.'
