  description: Make things awkward<sprite=0>
  resultText: '[s.name] decided to take a risk and ask [r.name] a weirdly personal
    question. [r.name]''s eyes grew wide with shock as [s.name] blurted out the question.



    "[r.name],
    I''m curious, how do you feel about pickles on pizza?" [r.name] asked, trying
    to hide [s.his] nervousness. [r.name] stared at [s.name] for a moment before
    bursting into laughter.



    "You''re something else, [s.name]. I''ve never
    been asked that before!" [r.name] chuckled. [s.name] joined in the laughter,
    relieved that the question wasn''t too off-putting. They continued their conversation,
    but [s.name] made a mental note to stick to safer topics in the future.'
