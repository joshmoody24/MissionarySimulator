  description: Obliterate them
  resultText: '[s.name] cleared [s.his] throat and leaned in, a mischievous glint
    in [s.his] eye. "Hey [r.name]," [s.he] said, "Your mother... she makes the best
    cookies in the world!" [r.name] blinked in surprise, then burst out laughing.
    "What? That''s the insult?" [r.he] said, still chuckling. "That''s the best you''ve
    got?"

    

    [s.name] just shrugged, a big grin on [s.his] face. "Hey,
    I figured why not spread a little sweetness instead of sourness, you know?" [r.name]
    nodded in agreement, still chuckling. "Well, I can''t argue with that. Thanks,
    [s.name]. You made my day." And with that, the two of them went back to spreading
    the gospel, still smiling from [s.name]''s silly "insult".'
