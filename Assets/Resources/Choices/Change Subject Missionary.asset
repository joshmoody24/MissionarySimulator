  description: Steer the convo in a different direction
  resultText: '[s.name] noticed that [r.name] was starting to become uncomfortable
    with the current topic of conversation. [s.name] didn''t want to risk ruining
    [r.his] relationship with [r.him], so [s.he] decided to change the subject to
    [related_topic].



    "[r.name], have you heard about [related_topic]? It''s
    fascinating. Would you like to hear more about it?" [r.name] perked up, grateful
    for the change in subject. [r.name] and [s.name] delved into a lively discussion
    about [related_topic] and [r.name] was impressed by [s.name]''s knowledge and
    enthusiasm. The conversation was much more enjoyable and productive than before,
    and [s.name] was glad [s.he] had made the choice to steer it in a different direction.'
