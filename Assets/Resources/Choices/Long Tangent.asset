  name: Go on a long tangent about [topic]
  description: Get ready to be sidetracked!
  resultText: '[s.name] couldn''t resist. [s.he] announced to [r.name], "Let me tell
    you about [topic]. Get ready for a wild ride of tangents and asides." And with
    that, [s.name] went on a hours-long exposition of all things [topic]. [r.name]
    was caught in the whirlwind, swept away in a sea of information and entertainment.
    After, [r.name] rubbed [r.his] temples, "Wow, [s.name], that was a wild tangent."
    But [s.name] just grinned, "I told you it was going to be a long one. Knowledge
    is power, right?" And with that, [s.name] was off on another tangent.'
