  description: What could go wrong?
  resultText: '[s.name] took a deep breath and approached [r.name]. [r.name] was
    getting a little too heated, and it was time to bring the temperature down a
    notch. [s.name] used a calm but firm tone to deliver the message: "Hey there,
    [r.name]. Let''s take a step back and COOL IT, okay?"

    

    At first,
    [r.name] seemed taken aback. [r.he] blinked a few times and stared blankly at
    [s.name]. But then, all of a sudden, [r.name]''s face crumpled and [r.he] burst
    into tears. "Oh no," [s.name] thought. "What did I do?"

    

    As it turned
    out, [r.name] was feeling a lot of guilt about a certain situation, and [s.name]''s
    gentle reminder to COOL IT was just the push [r.he] needed to confront those
    emotions. [r.Name] sobbed uncontrollably as the crushing weight of [r.his] guilt
    enveloped [r.him].

    

    But don''t worry, [s.name] was there to comfort
    [r.name]. [s.he] patted [r.him] on the back and murmured words of encouragement
    until [r.name] had calmed down. And, in the end, [r.name] was grateful for [s.name]''s
    intervention. "Thanks, [s.name]," [r.he] said, wiping away [r.his] tears. "I
    needed that."'
