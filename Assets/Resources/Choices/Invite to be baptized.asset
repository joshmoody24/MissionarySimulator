  description: Extend an invitation to make a covenant with God
  resultText: '[s.name] could feel the spirit guiding [s.him] in the conversation
    with [r.name]. [S.Name] knew it was the right time to extend an invitation for
    [r.name] to be baptized.

    

    "I hope you don''t mind me asking, [r.name],
    but have you ever considered being baptized? It''s a beautiful experience and
    a wonderful way to show your commitment to the gospel." [r.name]''s eyes lit
    up with curiosity and [s.name] could tell [r.he] was considering the invitation.
    [s.name] took the opportunity to explain more about the blessings and joy that
    come from being baptized and [r.name] seemed more interested with each passing
    moment. [r.name] agreed to think more about it and [s.name] left the conversation
    feeling grateful and blessed.'
